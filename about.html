            <p class="detail_para">Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, 
                a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay,
                 the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, 
                 a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence 
                 alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis,
                  whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. 
                  Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, 
                which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.
